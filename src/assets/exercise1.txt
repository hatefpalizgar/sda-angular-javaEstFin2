// Create a component called dog
// create an array variable named doggos in your app.component.ts file and fill it with similar data to: {name: 'Alfred'}
// Display the name of the doggies in the template using *ngFor directive
// if there are less than 2 objects in your doggos, display the line: "Who let the dogs out?" on the screen using *ngIf
// Add a button to the page that triggers a simple alert(use console.log()) and print out some woofs!
// If you are up for the challenge, then add another button that would add a dog to your current doggos
